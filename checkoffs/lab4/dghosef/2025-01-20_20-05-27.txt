make[1]: *** No rule to make target `check'.  Stop.
make: *** [libunix] Error 2
========================= 
To verify everything worked, make sure the /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/make -s -C libunix check command didn't lead to any errors and the gprof output table is correct.
gprof should show a lot of time in PUT32, GET32, and UART routines
=========================
